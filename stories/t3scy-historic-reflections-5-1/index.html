Soaring Corinthian pilasters ringing the nave and side aisles, the impossibly theatrical high altar—an explosion of colorful marbles—the many richly ornamented side altars, extensive gilding, and bold Tromp l’oeil paintings in the &quot;dome&quot; (never finished) at its crossing and bright frescoes in the nave ceiling together produce an overwhelming festive, sumptuous effect. </span></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>The Italian liberation celebrations disrupted our tour this day as well. On the one hand, the city was quieter because fewer people were at work or school, and on the other, sites were closed, streets blocked and routines disrupted. To top it off, it was also the day before the beatification of two catholic something–or–others, adding to the normal throng of tourists and pilgrims that normally congest the city, making for a veritable horde! Our indefatigable guides took it in stride — navigating around the blocked streets and closed sites and with few exceptions (see coliseum below) keeping us tourists blissfully unaware. </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:408px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:0;width:323px;height:485px;" src="media/4d909e24-55ff-4bc8-8c04-97483d3da002.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Our first principal stop was at the Circus Maximus, much the same as the coliseum, the site of staged public entertainments, like chariot races (Ben Hur&#39;s race in the movie was there, or more precisely a movie set like it) and when flooded, faux naval battle recreations along with gladiatorical combat*. Although the sacking of Rome by barbarians caused much damage, the city&#39;s monuments were largely destroyed by uncivilized remnants of the Roman people themselves (amazing how far they and other Europeans fell from grace — for a THOUSAND years!—there but for the grace of … you know the rest) the scale of the ruins were still stunning. We see some of them, including a distant peek–a-boo of the Forum at speed as the bus and tour guide rapidly wheel past them. </span><br><span></span><br><span>*Simone informed us that Hollywood got it wrong—the emperor didn&#39;t use thumbs up and down to render the fate of the vanquished—clenched fisted, he would swipe his outstretched thumb across his neck (as if slicing the throat) to condemn, or raise his outstretched arm with palm down to spare their life (essentially hailing their performance). It was this second gesture that was much later adopted by Hitler that may have led Hollywood to adopt the tamer gesture. He also shared his personal perspective of Italian governance—&quot;How you say? Botched up!&quot; Noting the rampant corruption and cronyism, and by way of example, that the Prime Minister of their tiny impoverished country, whose work is not that demanding, makes (as distinguished from &quot;earns&quot;) €20,000 </span><span class="bold italic"><span>per month</span></span><span>!

Argghhhh! All we could see of the oculus was a glimpse through a transom screen above the entry door! It was all undeniably impressive, but we were so disappointed to  leave without experiencing the full grandeur from within. It is only with a mini personal struggle that we move on without cursing the Catholics for their persistent dominance of this world heritage site. </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-18.947409733124005px;top:0;width:190px;height:238px;" src="media/2bc96eed-b3d4-4037-a3e0-779cc749c3bd.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:408px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-51px;top:0;width:544px;height:408px;" src="media/e9f2b7b4-d64e-436e-8a1b-e43ca74cc31b.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-68.68px;top:0;width:357px;height:238px;" src="media/70011ab7-97c6-4bb2-b6be-a75b1200640a.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>The inscription on the entablature translates to, &quot;Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, made [this building] when consul for the third time.&quot;</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-54.423076923076906px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/67a00905-f411-4c55-a5cd-fc93d2ffc4d3.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-41.747123119506085px;top:-53.790794964377824px;width:311px;height:208px;" src="media/0582ed17-7fa1-46fe-8e17-4ff5ceaa158b.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Barred from lingering by the throng and by our own determination to reach the Pantheon (and our bus) we tore ourselves away and struck out along our quickly improvised route to the Piazza della Rotonda and along the way burst upon the Roccoco Piazza di Sant&#39; Ignazio and the remarkable church dedicated to him.

Refusing to give up on seeing the Pantheon, we break into a cantor to make up time on our frantic whirlwind tour. Finally we glimpse our quarry and its front portico with massive 8–foot diameter granite Corinthian columns anchoring the surprisingly tiny Piazza della Rotonda that fronts the church (with the obligatory obelisk). \n\nOriginally commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD) as a private temple to all of the gods, or heaven (pantheon can shade to either meaning), all but the façade was destroyed twice by fires. Rebuilt by Trajan and later by Hadrian, it is revered for its classical forms and the coffered dome with oculus, still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome 1,860 years later. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, 142 feet (thus inscribing an imaginary sphere). The Jefferson Monument in D.C. is modeled upon it, reflecting his abiding reverence for classical architecture and the Pantheon in particular.\n\nAlthough definitely showing signs of its antiquity, it is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings. This may be due to being in continuous use throughout its history, first as a pagan temple and since the 7th century, as a Roman Catholic church dedicated to \"St. Mary and the Martyrs\" but informally known as \"Santa Maria Rotonda.\" And in our case this contemporary use led to a great disappointment, Catholic priests were officiating at some kind of ceremony, closing the interior to public access for the time we were there! Argghhhh! All we could see of the oculus was a glimpse through a transom screen above the entry door! It was all undeniably impressive, but we were so disappointed to  leave without experiencing the full grandeur from within. It is only with a mini personal struggle that we move on without cursing the Catholics for their persistent dominance of this world heritage site.
