Looking back, we see now just how small our Riviera is compared to an enormous cruiser out of Turkey (carrying a rude and comically obnoxious group of Eastern Europeans and Asians—ugly Americans indeed). </span><br><span></span><br><span>After a brief discourse on the natural history of the island, Arina tells us of the peculiarities and hardships of life on the rim of a giant volcano. An earthquake in 1956 destroyed 80 percent of the buildings on the island, and now, with the Greek economy in shambles since joining the EU we see buildings all over standing unfinished and abandoned, skeletal hulks slowly eroding in the relentless wind. Arina notes that, &quot;The only hospital is little more than a glorified first aid station—women must go to Athens to deliver their babies after enduring an eight hour ferry ride!&quot;</span><br><span></span><br><span>Comprising thirty–four square miles of land area, most of it under cultivation along the broad slopes banking to the east, with a few small towns and a total population of 15,500, Santorini remarkably has 33 churches. This doesn&#39;t include the ubiquitous private chapels that dot the passing landscape practically as numerous as houses. </span><br><span></span><br><span>The flora (including cactus) show this to be more or less a desert island. Consequently the grapevines we see are all grown low to the ground to protect them from the wind, with little bowl shaped depressions around their trunks that gather moisture from the passing moist sea air at night. Arina tells us, &quot;on our little island, there is more wine than water, more churches than houses, and more donkeys than people!&quot; </span><br><span></span><br><span>Our tour didn&#39;t permit time for visiting the archeological site at Acrotiri, the town near the ruins of a Bronze Age Minoan settlement destroyed 3,600 years ago when Thera exploded in what may have been one of the largest eruptions in recorded history. Our guide explained that much like Pompeii, the eruption buried the settlement in a pyroclastic flow that preserved many buildings and artifacts. The event is sometimes called the Minoan eruption because it may have ended the whole civilization when the ensuing tsunami wiped out most of the cities of distant Crete where the empire was centered. We&#39;re told it may also have spawned the myth of Atlantis, and the story of Exodus in the Bible (specifically the parting of the seas). </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-3.451509606587365px;width:493px;height:329px;" src="media/ebae69a9-ecb6-4d89-85bb-aaac554a3338.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-2px;width:323px;height:242px;" src="media/ccf02c34-1405-40b9-ae0d-d6ad99bca630.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-139.93290043290042px;top:0;width:431px;height:323px;" src="media/c305e80c-edcd-4f2b-a8e9-c7efe3383af4.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-47.34615384615384px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/e40f3984-9a97-4b1f-bb1a-e0b9486206c4.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Rising to the a treeless windblown summit—a lonely outpost of antennae the only inhabitants— we get a grand overview of the whole island and caldera.

As we make our way along the broad slope of the old volcano, threatening clouds begin to mount and the temperature drops—unleashing a torrent of rain and a flash flood almost the moment we step off the coach.

Edging closer, still about 120 miles from mainland Greece, the landmass suddenly resolves into a circular archipelago of spiny islands, collectively known as Santorini, that are actually remnants of a collapsed shield volcano that was at least the size of Mt. Etna before it blew up. A stiff and unseasonably chilly breeze greets us as we sail into the central lagoon that fills the caldera, skirting below the 1000–foot cliffs of the main island, also called Santorini, or Thera, from ancient times. </span><br><span></span><br><span>Passing beneath Oia, encrusted like barnacles clinging to the cliffs above, we marveled at the beauty of this place, sparkling white in the low morning sun now peaking through the scudding clouds and look forward to it as our first destination of the morning. As we sail past to anchor mid–bay, we can see the capital city, Fira (or Thira depending on who you ask, which is also the name of the principality). At first there appears to be no access from the bay—the quay and tram at Skalos a thousand feet below are too small to discern at a distance. We&#39;re informed our tenders will cross the bay to Athinios, the principal &#39;harbor&#39; on the caldera side of the island, where we will catch our tour bus and guide.</span></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>As quick as it came, the rain let up just as we reboarded our coach bound for Fira.

It is clear that tourism is the dominant industry, each cruise ship creating a tidal wave of people. Still we managed to find a restaurant with a view, and only a 20–minute wait. But first we trekked the length of town, visited the Acrotiri museum (interesting but disappointing, the dig site is no doubt a much better alternative) and experienced the gale–force winds in our summer clothes (the natives swore that this sort of weather &#39;never&#39; happens this time of year). </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/f573e3d2-eb45-46ba-bd4f-69ad4abd383c.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Intrepid Seattleites as we are, we don&#39;t let the rain phase us at first, but as the unrelenting deluge makes a treacherous river of the polished marble street, we seek refuge in a colorful shop or two, finally alighting in the Happy Fish Spa. Inside are rows of tanks filled with salt water and teaming with little fish waiting to nibble on your feet!

Edging closer, still about 120 miles from mainland Greece, the landmass suddenly resolves into a circular archipelago of spiny islands, collectively known as Santorini, that are actually remnants of a collapsed shield volcano that was at least the size of Mt. Etna before it blew up. A stiff and unseasonably chilly breeze greets us as we sail into the central lagoon that fills the caldera, skirting below the 1000–foot cliffs of the main island, also called Santorini, or Thera, from ancient times. \n\nPassing beneath Oia, encrusted like barnacles clinging to the cliffs above, we marveled at the beauty of this place, sparkling white in the low morning sun now peaking through the scudding clouds and look forward to it as our first destination of the morning. As we sail past to anchor mid–bay, we can see the capital city, Fira (or Thira depending on who you ask, which is also the name of the principality). At first there appears to be no access from the bay—the quay and tram at Skalos a thousand feet below are too small to discern at a distance. We're informed our tenders will cross the bay to Athinios, the principal 'harbor' on the caldera side of the island, where we will catch our tour bus and guide.","rich_text":"","text_style":"body","modifiers":[],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":11461359,"updated_at":1452836221,"created_at":1452836221,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_11461359","updated_at":1452836221,"created_at":1452836221,"type":"image","image":{"id":2542264,"uuid":244947660579509440,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/33e1d363-6f96-487f-9d28-00dde41fc7af.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1365}}},"zoom":1.743713140487671,"focalpoint":{"x":0.4280184870307434,"y":0.4663093565812879},"size":{"width":1024,"height":683},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":4},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":11461360,"updated_at":1452836221,"created_at":1452836221,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_11461360","updated_at":1452836221,"created_at":1452836221,"type":"text","text":{"id":2502631,"plain_text":"The crossing is cold and choppy on Santorinian tenders dedicated to transporting cruise-ship passengers to Athinios (we are told that our ship's tenders are too underpowered for navigating these treacherous waters).

Looking back, we see now just how small our Riviera is compared to an enormous cruiser out of Turkey (carrying a rude and comically obnoxious group of Eastern Europeans and Asians—ugly Americans indeed). \n\nAfter a brief discourse on the natural history of the island, Arina tells us of the peculiarities and hardships of life on the rim of a giant volcano. An earthquake in 1956 destroyed 80 percent of the buildings on the island, and now, with the Greek economy in shambles since joining the EU we see buildings all over standing unfinished and abandoned, skeletal hulks slowly eroding in the relentless wind. Arina notes that, \"The only hospital is little more than a glorified first aid station—women must go to Athens to deliver their babies after enduring an eight hour ferry ride!\"\n\nComprising thirty–four square miles of land area, most of it under cultivation along the broad slopes banking to the east, with a few small towns and a total population of 15,500, Santorini remarkably has 33 churches. This doesn't include the ubiquitous private chapels that dot the passing landscape practically as numerous as houses. \n\nThe flora (including cactus) show this to be more or less a desert island. Consequently the grapevines we see are all grown low to the ground to protect them from the wind, with little bowl shaped depressions around their trunks that gather moisture from the passing moist sea air at night. Arina tells us, \"on our little island, there is more wine than water, more churches than houses, and more donkeys than people!\" \n\nOur tour didn't permit time for visiting the archeological site at Acrotiri, the town near the ruins of a Bronze Age Minoan settlement destroyed 3,600 years ago when Thera exploded in what may have been one of the largest eruptions in recorded history. Our guide explained that much like Pompeii, the eruption buried the settlement in a pyroclastic flow that preserved many buildings and artifacts. The event is sometimes called the Minoan eruption because it may have ended the whole civilization when the ensuing tsunami wiped out most of the cities of distant Crete where the empire was centered. We're told it may also have spawned the myth of Atlantis, and the story of Exodus in the Bible (specifically the parting of the seas).
