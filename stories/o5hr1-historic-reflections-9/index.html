As we make our way down the grade it gradually dawns on us that virtually all the gravel we see around us is the ground–up remains of these ancient priceless ruins.

The region, indeed, the whole country is a mixmaster of western and eastern ancient history, but most of that isn&#39;t apparent in crass little Kusadasi.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The people we meet are friendly, but too often vaguely unpleasant and at turns creepy. Passing through customs onto the wharf we encounter our first phalanx of noisome &quot;merchants&quot; aggressively hawking their wares at the steady stream of tourist &quot;marks&quot; that must weave through them. It confirms the warnings the cruise director offered regarding the many unscrupulous shops and charlatans we were advised to avoid—many selling low quality, pirated or fake goods at exorbitant prices that are always negotiable if you&#39;re willing to endure the ritualistic process of haggling them down to a reasonable sum.

What may seem appalling to us is an indication of sophisticated urban planning for public health—each hole strategically perched above a moving stream of water that would&#39;ve continuously flushed the waste away to the sea.</span><br><span></span><br><span>At the base of the long sweep of the stoa stood the partially restored Library of Ephesus, at one time one of the three most prominent and important libraries in the world—on a par with Alexandria. The Turks had re-erected many of the toppled stones of the main façade and interior walls of the five–story structure (with one underground). Still visible on some of the walls were the carved inscriptions celebrating Greek knowledge and history. Also preserved was the underground connecting tunnel to the brothel we&#39;d just past up the street. Our guide shared that it seems the prominent men of the city would gather in the evening at the library on the pretext of an important meeting with the other gentlemen in town—ostensibly to discuss politics or some philosophical debate—but in reality descend to the tunnel and secretly access the brothel for an illicit unsanctioned liaison—the wife at home no doubt relieved that public appearances were maintained.  </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/1998aae6-68f9-4581-9815-65311511cfb6.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-3px;width:493px;height:329px;" src="media/8301c664-3db2-467e-a52a-ba6bb1187688.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-9.5px;width:323px;height:215px;" src="media/246f1dae-cdcc-4e40-ac8d-c2c6438b46a4.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-6px;width:493px;height:329px;" src="media/58a8007f-71f9-4854-94d4-83114159f637.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:408px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-12.15432098765433px;width:323px;height:485px;" src="media/fdd861b0-801d-4b46-99ff-ea6fc3d3f1b3.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-38.5px;width:153px;height:230px;" src="media/90028ebb-8a47-4bf5-b801-d4897b938363.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-102px;top:0;width:357px;height:238px;" src="media/a934b7c8-0a90-467e-a44f-ab9935fe954a.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-1.1388888888888857px;width:323px;height:215px;" src="media/dab3d358-a79a-46f2-b46d-ee23bf089d3c.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa pull_quote abs" style="font-size:30.529411764705884px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Ephesus</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-31px;top:0;width:215px;height:323px;" src="media/274180e1-dec5-47ed-aacd-0ab9dbdc2674.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-31px;top:0;width:215px;height:323px;" src="media/fe123b1f-8747-4987-a356-e3d838a56535.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-81px;top:0;width:485px;height:323px;" src="media/67f06578-ba30-466d-b63a-61841249ef5a.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-14.149093904448108px;top:0;width:181px;height:238px;" src="media/bc93d97f-7098-4bf5-aa10-c50fa06c8640.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Although impressive, particularly for the knowledge it represents, the library is justifiably not revered for its beauty. Although the craftsmanship is superlative, it did not achieve classical Greek ideals of proportion and order—really rather a hodge podge.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The archetypal amphitheater is immense, suggesting a formidable population in the metropolitan area that belies our concepts of ancient civilizations. Again, the obvious liberties taken with commingled reproductions and authentic original stones may trouble the astute purist, but modern tourists clearly benefit from the effort to recreate what this immense edifice must have been like when it still functioned. It definitely challenges our assumptions about how modern and advanced we are today.

Luckily the gypsy pair running the camel operation were preoccupied shaking down another tourist so we could escape unmolested, grateful to be back on the bus. This vaguely reminds me of how we felt years ago when we went to Mt. Rushmore, passing through a wilderness despoiled by out–of–place billboards hawking tourist shop junk that we shouldn&#39;t miss.

Still visible on some of the walls were the carved inscriptions celebrating Greek knowledge and history. Also preserved was the underground connecting tunnel to the brothel we'd just past up the street. Our guide shared that it seems the prominent men of the city would gather in the evening at the library on the pretext of an important meeting with the other gentlemen in town—ostensibly to discuss politics or some philosophical debate—but in reality descend to the tunnel and secretly access the brothel for an illicit unsanctioned liaison—the wife at home no doubt relieved that public appearances were maintained.

Again, the obvious liberties taken with commingled reproductions and authentic original stones may trouble the astute purist, but modern tourists clearly benefit from the effort to recreate what this immense edifice must have been like when it still functioned. It definitely challenges our assumptions about how modern and advanced we are today. For me, it was a treat to see a site that I'd thoroughly studied whilst in architecture school.

Confronted by a long line, she soon realized a gypsy woman was guarding the entrance to the park's public restrooms, like some kind of troll, demanding payment to determine who got in next! We experienced one final obstacle, just before the busses, where Gavin snapped a picture of a camel, only to learn that he was expected to pay for the privilege! Luckily the gypsy pair running the camel operation were preoccupied shaking down another tourist so we could escape unmolested, grateful to be back on the bus. This vaguely reminds me of how we felt years ago when we went to Mt. Rushmore, passing through a wilderness despoiled by out–of–place billboards hawking tourist shop junk that we shouldn't miss. A similarly unfortunate juxtaposition, but more colorful and entertaining in this context.","text_style":"body","modifiers":[],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2}},{"id":11461513,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_11461513","type":"image","image":{"id":2498281,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/b4509edf-2144-482a-a555-a474cd7705f9.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1536}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5432098765432098},"size":{"width":1024,"height":768}}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":4,"height":3}},{"id":11461514,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_11461514","type":"image","image":{"id":2500963,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/05e6d5fe-252e-4f7e-96a4-a4b3d720420f.jpg","size":{"width":1365,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":683,"height":1024}}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":3}},{"id":11461515,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_11461515","type":"image","image":{"id":2498283,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/c3d3a231-12f5-408d-9226-0a96fe9c31ae.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1365}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":683}}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":4}}],"user":{"id":181019,"full_name":"Mark Elster","avatar_image":{"id":1275710,"representations":{"320":{"url":"media/eae9994e-c728-4b47-b6d1-a51c5b935560.jpeg","size":{"width":200,"height":200}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":200,"height":200}},"cover_image":{"id":1325676,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/401c8d89-a098-4d35-9fa6-c793c4a22de9.jpg","size":{"width":384,"height":256}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":384,"height":256}}}},"offline":true,config:{env:"production",locale:"en"}}</script><script src="media/eaec5663-9104-4e90-923f-097c596c7d1a.js"></script><script src="media/23147560-4808-42f5-8037-71c48163af1f.js"></script><script src="media/bf602aca-c3a9-4e55-b00b-c76a80fd2ac3.js"></script></body></html>
