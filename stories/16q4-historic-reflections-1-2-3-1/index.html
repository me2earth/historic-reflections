But Monaco and Monte Carlo would have to wait—the four of us would begin the day with our first long bus tour (again, mom and dad took a similar tour of the region with less walking and climbing). After landing ashore we met our loquacious guide Michele, boarded our coach and proceeded to climb and literally bore our way up and through the mountainside. The conspicuous ingenuity of the engineering feats necessary  to make these rocky cliffs habitable and navigable vacillates between admiration and an underlying impression of insanity. &quot;Why not make it easier on yourselves?&quot; one has to wonder. Therein lies one of several reasons places like this fascinate so—aside from the spectacular artistry and craft, the evident difficulty and improbability of the construction itself engenders awe.</span></div><div class="text abs pre aa pull_quote abs" style="font-size:30.529411764705884px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Full Itinerary</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-17px;top:0;width:357px;height:238px;" src="media/9cb5a2b9-d33a-4c3b-939d-d9732a5266e3.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Whirlwind seems an appropriate descriptor for our itinerary.

At one very tight switchback we got stuck because of two cars illegally, and stupidly parked. So several of us guys in the bus got out, picked them up and moved them! Our guide (and our driver) were transfixed by the American take–no–prisoners problem solving and gung–ho attitude—gushing their gratitude for the rescue.</span></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>On the long drive to Cannes, Michele told us more of the history of the region and Monaco in particular. It had begun as a lonely Greek outpost called Monoikos (&quot;Single House&quot; after its singular temple to Hercules). Bounced between competing city states over the centuries, it eventually grew to a much larger principality, of Italian roots but under the protection of the French kings. Gradually it lost virtually all of its arable territory in the tug of war between Spain and France until 500 acres of densely populated land was all that was left. To use NancyEllen&#39;s visualization, this is roughly equivalent in area to the Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle (it has since grown somewhat in area, including a planned new ward reclaimed from the sea). The remaining minuscule holding was wholly unsustainable under the circumstances of those predatory times, predating capitalism and free markets. Without income–producing lands, the desperate Grimaldi Prince Charles (the namesake of Monte Carlo, literally, Mount Charles), copied a fairly new idea: he decided to base the failing economy of the city–state around a business enterprise rather than feudal holdings. The business? The famed Monte Carlo casino. Although he wouldn&#39;t have thought of it this way, he chose to shift the principality&#39;s economic system to something like mercantilism, not quite capitalism, but effectively saving the economy and independence. The venture didn&#39;t really take off till he borrowed funds to build a railroad so wealthy Europeans and royalty could travel to the remote and hard to reach land.</span><br><span></span><br><span>We were told of his descendant, Prince Rainier, who upon encountering new economic problems was advised by his friend and high–rolling gambler, Aristotle Onassis, that the problem was one of a too narrow a customer base—pointing out that the huge market of Americans didn&#39;t even know the place existed. He suggested that the bachelor prince needed a splashy wedding to an American celebrity to draw attention to Monaco—done correctly—wealthy America would enthusiastically embrace the country and its casino as a popular and exclusive destination.</span><br><span></span><br><span>The plan hatched, the conspirators ran through a list of candidates. Marilyn Monroe and others were rejected, the Prince having seen Grace Kelly in 1954&#39;s </span><span class="italic"><span>Country Girl</span></span><span>, had made up his mind. But Grace was in love with Oleg Casini, whom she was forbidden by family and Catholic church to marry (he&#39;d been divorced) and not looking for another relationship. So the conspirators conscripted a trusted journalist ally to stage an apparent &#39;chance meeting&#39; on a train — offering Grace a rare audience with a European Prince. </span><br><span></span><br><span>The last barrier to the union was Grace&#39;s contract to MGM, requiring one more movie. Always a woman of honor, she went to MGM and explained her desire to marry the Prince, and the parties quickly agreed to a mutually beneficial resolution—MGM would forego the planned contracted movie, in favor of having exclusive rights to document her Hollywood–produced wedding, Onassis and Rainier could not have planned the outcome any better! MGM financed the whole affair, got their movie, that became a sensation—the Prince got his flashy American celebrity bride, and the attendant priceless publicity that produced the desired effect on Monaco&#39;s economic fortunes without spending a cent from the depleted treasury. In both effect and actual results, an American movie star saved a forgotten and once again failing European principality by virtue of her fame and the ensuing publicity she generated over the course of two generations.</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:309px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:408px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-17px;top:0;width:272px;height:408px;" src="media/ce3913dc-5154-44e3-b1f9-ca79679e340d.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:493px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-7.5px;width:493px;height:508px;" src="media/2f21c255-8291-4898-9bbc-ac2d4507ce76.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Marseille&#39;s Byzantine style Nôtre Dame de la Garde Bassilica is our first spectacular European–monument experience of the trip. A colorful belfry tower marks a beautiful church that in some ways seems more a fortress (including a drawbridge with portcullis). The view from its commanding promontory is equally stunning. </span><br><span></span><br><span>From there we descended back to the harbor for a too quick bus tour of various scattered sites followed by an on–our–own Very pleasant walking tour that ended at the even more Byzantine Cathedral of Marseille (Cathédrale Sainte–Marie–Majeure).  A riotous pile of alternating dark and light stacked rusticated and carved stone, mosaics and stained glass. Not to our taste but mesmerizing and impressive none the less! </span><br><span></span><br><span>In the city we are struck by the juxtaposition of opulent edifices crammed cheek by jowl against shockingly decaying wrecks barely masquerading as buildings (that people apparently willingly live in). Everywhere there are hints of a suffering community that has begun to resign itself to accelerating decline—foreshadowing the growing unrest, like in so many other places across Europe, as Muslim immigrants with no desire to assimilate gradually destroy a culture much like a cancer will consume its host.  It left us more than a little sad. Sensing this subliminally and overtly, we enjoyed our time there but find ourselves not wishing to go back. We leave doubting that cosmopolitan Marseille is likely to survive the relentless assault by a barbaric and crude culture of hate that has begun to exude from its pores.  </span></div><div class="text abs pre aa body center abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span></span><span class="italic"><span>Grace’s wedding gown (indeed, the entire wedding) was a </span><br><span>gift from the MGM film studios — designed by Helen Rose</span></span><span></span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:309px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-3px;width:238px;height:159px;" src="media/b420bac0-92d3-49e8-bd4e-14944e899c0e.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>A stern and loveless but openly philandering man, Rainier was not a good husband or father. Grace gradually came to realize she was effectively imprisoned in her own adopted country, in a sham marriage, leading an opulent but hollow life, but redeemed by her children (at first) and her charitable enterprises. The dysfunctional family produced famously and </span><span class="italic"><span>notoriously</span></span><span> screwed up children. The most balanced among them being Prince Albert—the current reasonably competent monarch (as monarchs go). </span><br><span></span><br><span>Michele related that as a young man Albert stuttered horribly in French, the language of his imperious and disapproving father (who abhorred Albert&#39;s interest in the arts to the exclusion of more manly pursuits). As soon as Rainier was dead, Albert commenced speaking it fluently! He also went on inevitably to emulate his father&#39;s playboy tendencies and his marital infidelities when he was compelled by princely duties to marry late in life.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Grace died tragically while driving her daughter Stephanie down a winding mountain road (actually there is no other type in the region) in a spectacular crash that killed her instantly. Controversy surrounds the crash because some claim that 16–year old Stephanie was actually the driver and that a compliant press covered it up to prevent prosecution for underage driving and the shame of contributing to her mother&#39;s death—but the consensus is against this account (not the least because Grace was quite strict and would not have condoned law–breaking). </span><br><span></span><br><span>Michele wrapped up this truly sad (and exquisitely rehearsed) saga just as beautiful Cannes wheeled into sight. The mega-yachts of the super wealthy were lined up 30 deep in the harbor and preparations for the famed film festival were underway (a week later and our tour would have been disrupted significantly). Palatial homes, five–star hotels and upper crust shops abound everywhere we looked—such a stark contrast to moribund Marseille!</span><br><span></span><br><span>Off the main boulevards, we wind through confined little cobbled streets serpentining up the steep hillside to the inevitable church, along the way enjoying the centuries old residential district on a short guided walking tour. We are smitten by the saturated sun–drenched colors and the many interesting doors and other architectural details. The guys and I quickly notice that Nance is compelled by her nature to knock on the doors that have knockers (most of them do). </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-3px;width:238px;height:159px;" src="media/4ce69d8b-1824-494a-b0bc-f77c23e26919.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-166px;top:0;width:485px;height:323px;" src="media/d4f714d9-8c10-4873-ba8c-edc53aa7ec3f.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-17px;top:-104.5px;width:272px;height:362px;" src="media/2bb5e037-5ae9-4c14-9d63-7fd4d1969e98.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-81px;width:323px;height:485px;" src="media/d8365343-6ec5-4421-92bc-a92cb8ffd112.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:309px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:408px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-187px;top:0;width:612px;height:408px;" src="media/6278c3c4-c890-4823-bfe2-0f7034a6b839.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-30px;top:-126.5px;width:383px;height:576px;" src="media/5eee71a9-4135-41aa-8fea-7cc780459905.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Day 3, Wednesday, April 23rd: Monte Carlo, Monaco, with a long excursion through the Cote D&#39;Azur (literally, Azure Coast, otherwise known as the French Riviera) guided by Michele (who met Princess Grace several times) and driver, Fabio, with stops in Cannes (of film–fest and celebrity runway fame), Grasse (French perfumeries), and the impossibly quaint medieval walled village of St. Paul De Vence — followed by an extensive on–our–own walking tour of Monaco (yes, we toured very nearly the whole country, including part of the impending Grand Prix course, on foot). To get ashore, a quick trip in a ship&#39;s tender was necessary because the picturesque port (like everything else here) was too small to accommodate our medium sized ship. NancyEllen describes the time here, to those in Seattle who haven&#39;t been, like a trip to Lake Union, it&#39;s practically that small.</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-31px;top:0;width:215px;height:323px;" src="media/f9fef4d0-1933-44bb-ba31-fba9c546f528.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"> </div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54px;top:-10000px;width:238px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-3px;width:238px;height:159px;" src="media/2833f2c0-42c2-48c8-b995-7f8a3c61b5ee.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Day 1, Easter Sunday, April 20th: depart from Seattle to Frankfurt, Germany, with a 2½ hour layover, and a nearly </span><span class="italic"><span>two mile</span></span><span> walk between gates </span><span class="italic"><span>after</span></span><span> the airport tram ride, then onto Barcelona, Spain arriving on April 21st . Passed by the very unusual Cementiri de Montjuïc, a cemetery embedded in the steep flanks of a small limestone mountain pockmarked with thousands of small crypts that borders the city. Regret not being able to see it more closely, the bus rushing on by too fast to even snap a photo (this was something we would have to get used to).</span><br><span></span><br><span>As the scenery darts past, Gavin tells us that Spaniards pronounce their soft S sounds wrong. He states emphatically that somewhere along the way they began to substitute the voiceless dental fricative (a hard th sound, as in </span><span class="italic"><span>Thursday</span></span><span>) for many S sounds in speech. This was by way of advising us to say </span><span class="italic"><span>Barthelona</span></span><span>, not </span><span class="italic"><span>Barcelona</span></span><span> as we would expect. Needleth to thay, thumb of uth, had thumb thoughth about thith, and much laughter enthued. Mothtly, we thcoffed at the whole prepothterouth idea!</span><br><span></span><br><span>But sure enough, as we arrived at the ship all the locals offered a very gracious, &quot;Welcome to Barthelona!&quot; Although there is a well known story about a Spanish King who had a lisp, that in turn compelled the populous to mispronounce the letters c and z to avoid embarrassing him, it is not true. The explanation is far less fanciful and entertaining, having more to do with the unpredictable ways in which languages evolve over time in different regions. But it&#39;s still funny and amazing to us that the people here in the epicenter of the Hispanic world don&#39;t speak their own language correctly. Probably similar to what we will someday find if we visit Britain (and no doubt what they think of us). </span><br><span></span><br><span>Boarding the boat, we are delighted to find our rooms and the Riviera to be even better than expected. Embarkation is in the afternoon, no time for tours, but our first dinner is at sea in the swanky Red Ginger dining room. Great food, and conversation about our expectations for tomorrow make for a nice fifty–third birthday celebration that I&#39;m unlikely to see surpassed.</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs"

Passed by the very unusual Cementiri de Montjuïc, a cemetery embedded in the steep flanks of a small limestone mountain pockmarked with thousands of small crypts that borders the city. Regret not being able to see it more closely, the bus rushing on by too fast to even snap a photo (this was something we would have to get used to).\n\nAs the scenery darts past, Gavin tells us that Spaniards pronounce their soft S sounds wrong. He states emphatically that somewhere along the way they began to substitute the voiceless dental fricative (a hard th sound, as in Thursday) for many S sounds in speech. This was by way of advising us to say Barthelona, not Barcelona as we would expect. Needleth to thay, thumb of uth, had thumb thoughth about thith, and much laughter enthued. Mothtly, we thcoffed at the whole prepothterouth idea!\n\nBut sure enough, as we arrived at the ship all the locals offered a very gracious, \"Welcome to Barthelona!\" Although there is a well known story about a Spanish King who had a lisp, that in turn compelled the populous to mispronounce the letters c and z to avoid embarrassing him, it is not true. The explanation is far less fanciful and entertaining, having more to do with the unpredictable ways in which languages evolve over time in different regions. But it's still funny and amazing to us that the people here in the epicenter of the Hispanic world don't speak their own language correctly. Probably similar to what we will someday find if we visit Britain (and no doubt what they think of us). \n\nBoarding the boat, we are delighted to find our rooms and the Riviera to be even better than expected. Embarkation is in the afternoon, no time for tours, but our first dinner is at sea in the swanky Red Ginger dining room. Great food, and conversation about our expectations for tomorrow make for a nice fifty–third birthday celebration that I'm unlikely to see surpassed.","text_style":"body","modifiers":[{"range":[114,122],"style":["italic"]},{"range":[142,147],"style":["italic"]},{"range":[784,792],"style":["italic"]},{"range":[861,871],"style":["italic"]},{"range":[877,886],"style":["italic"]}],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2}},{"id":12149393,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149393","type":"image","image":{"id":1279728,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/c4f090ee-8b2b-431a-9f5e-a7d472ff74e0.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1536}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":768}}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2}},{"id":12149394,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149394","type":"text","text":{"id":2595973,"plain_text":"Marseille","text_style":"pull_quote","modifiers":[],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2}},{"id":12149395,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149395","type":"text","text":{"id":2595974,"plain_text":"Day 2, Tuesday, April 22nd: Marseille, France begins with a tour for the guys and us—mom and dad taking a similar tour without stair climbing—of the city highlights, guided by Jaques and a lanky bus driver who looked like our own Ryan back home.

A riotous pile of alternating dark and light stacked rusticated and carved stone, mosaics and stained glass. Not to our taste but mesmerizing and impressive none the less! \n\nIn the city we are struck by the juxtaposition of opulent edifices crammed cheek by jowl against shockingly decaying wrecks barely masquerading as buildings (that people apparently willingly live in). Everywhere there are hints of a suffering community that has begun to resign itself to accelerating decline—foreshadowing the growing unrest, like in so many other places across Europe, as Muslim immigrants with no desire to assimilate gradually destroy a culture much like a cancer will consume its host.  It left us more than a little sad. Sensing this subliminally and overtly, we enjoyed our time there but find ourselves not wishing to go back.

It had begun as a lonely Greek outpost called Monoikos (\"Single House\" after its singular temple to Hercules). Bounced between competing city states over the centuries, it eventually grew to a much larger principality, of Italian roots but under the protection of the French kings. Gradually it lost virtually all of its arable territory in the tug of war between Spain and France until 500 acres of densely populated land was all that was left. To use NancyEllen's visualization, this is roughly equivalent in area to the Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle (it has since grown somewhat in area, including a planned new ward reclaimed from the sea). The remaining minuscule holding was wholly unsustainable under the circumstances of those predatory times, predating capitalism and free markets. Without income–producing lands, the desperate Grimaldi Prince Charles (the namesake of Monte Carlo, literally, Mount Charles), copied a fairly new idea: he decided to base the failing economy of the city–state around a business enterprise rather than feudal holdings. The business? The famed Monte Carlo casino. Although he wouldn't have thought of it this way, he chose to shift the principality's economic system to something like mercantilism, not quite capitalism, but effectively saving the economy and independence. The venture didn't really take off till he borrowed funds to build a railroad so wealthy Europeans and royalty could travel to the remote and hard to reach land.\n\nWe were told of his descendant, Prince Rainier, who upon encountering new economic problems was advised by his friend and high–rolling gambler, Aristotle Onassis, that the problem was one of a too narrow a customer base—pointing out that the huge market of Americans didn't even know the place existed. He suggested that the bachelor prince needed a splashy wedding to an American celebrity to draw attention to Monaco—done correctly—wealthy America would enthusiastically embrace the country and its casino as a popular and exclusive destination.\n\nThe plan hatched, the conspirators ran through a list of candidates. Marilyn Monroe and others were rejected, the Prince having seen Grace Kelly in 1954's Country Girl, had made up his mind. But Grace was in love with Oleg Casini, whom she was forbidden by family and Catholic church to marry (he'd been divorced) and not looking for another relationship. So the conspirators conscripted a trusted journalist ally to stage an apparent 'chance meeting' on a train — offering Grace a rare audience with a European Prince. \n\nThe last barrier to the union was Grace's contract to MGM, requiring one more movie. Always a woman of honor, she went to MGM and explained her desire to marry the Prince, and the parties quickly agreed to a mutually beneficial resolution—MGM would forego the planned contracted movie, in favor of having exclusive rights to document her Hollywood–produced wedding, Onassis and Rainier could not have planned the outcome any better! MGM financed the whole affair, got their movie, that became a sensation—the Prince got his flashy American celebrity bride, and the attendant priceless publicity that produced the desired effect on Monaco's economic fortunes without spending a cent from the depleted treasury. In both effect and actual results, an American movie star saved a forgotten and once again failing European principality by virtue of her fame and the ensuing publicity she generated over the course of two generations.","text_style":"body","modifiers":[{"range":[2290,2302],"style":["italic"]}],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2}},{"id":12149418,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149418","type":"image","image":{"id":1421684,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/2f21c255-8291-4898-9bbc-ac2d4507ce76.jpg","size":{"width":600,"height":618}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":600,"height":618}}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":6}},{"id":12149419,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149419","type":"text","text":{"id":2595982,"plain_text":"Grace’s wedding gown (indeed, the entire wedding) was a \ngift from the MGM film studios — designed by Helen Rose","text_style":"body","modifiers":[{"range":[0,112],"style":["italic"]}],"alignment":"center"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":2}},{"id":12149420,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149420","type":"text","text":{"id":2595983,"plain_text":"A stern and loveless but openly philandering man, Rainier was not a good husband or father. Grace gradually came to realize she was effectively imprisoned in her own adopted country, in a sham marriage, leading an opulent but hollow life, but redeemed by her children (at first) and her charitable enterprises. The dysfunctional family produced famously and notoriously screwed up children. The most balanced among them being Prince Albert—the current reasonably competent monarch (as monarchs go). \n\nMichele related that as a young man Albert stuttered horribly in French, the language of his imperious and disapproving father (who abhorred Albert's interest in the arts to the exclusion of more manly pursuits). As soon as Rainier was dead, Albert commenced speaking it fluently! He also went on inevitably to emulate his father's playboy tendencies and his marital infidelities when he was compelled by princely duties to marry late in life.\n\nGrace died tragically while driving her daughter Stephanie down a winding mountain road (actually there is no other type in the region) in a spectacular crash that killed her instantly. Controversy surrounds the crash because some claim that 16–year old Stephanie was actually the driver and that a compliant press covered it up to prevent prosecution for underage driving and the shame of contributing to her mother's death—but the consensus is against this account (not the least because Grace was quite strict and would not have condoned law–breaking). \n\nMichele wrapped up this truly sad (and exquisitely rehearsed) saga just as beautiful Cannes wheeled into sight. The mega-yachts of the super wealthy were lined up 30 deep in the harbor and preparations for the famed film festival were underway (a week later and our tour would have been disrupted significantly). Palatial homes, five–star hotels and upper crust shops abound everywhere we looked—such a stark contrast to moribund Marseille!\n\nOff the main boulevards, we wind through confined little cobbled streets serpentining up the steep hillside to the inevitable church, along the way enjoying the centuries old residential district on a short guided walking tour. We are smitten by the saturated sun–drenched colors and the many interesting doors and other architectural details. The guys and I quickly notice that Nance is compelled by her nature to knock on the doors that have knockers (most of them do).
