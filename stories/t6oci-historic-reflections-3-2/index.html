The perfect exemplar of a well preserved medieval walled town. Except for modern wares and associated signage, and a few other amenities, it is as if development was arrested 500–600 years ago.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Impossibly narrow passages, stone walls and cobbled streets transport the visitor to another time. A time that is outright </span><span class="bold italic"><span>illegal</span></span><span> in America! More and more, as we visit various sites, I am struck at how delightful they are, and how forbidden these architectural treats are to everyday America— forbidden to us at home by the well–meaning but darkly oppressive overlords of the administrative state who have decided to take care of us and prevent all manner of imagined and real harms—at the expense of variety, wonder, and imagination. It is abundantly clear, in contrast with this environment, that it is not worth the price. </span><br><span></span><br><span>The problem for urban planners everywhere is denialism of the unpredictable (and therefore un–plan–able) wonders of emergent order. The best environments aren&#39;t planned, they emerge from the myriad decisions of individuals. Medieval and Renaissance Europe is a testament to this reality so central to human nature. It is too bad that we deny its full flower in our country (I also blame the lobbyists, lawyers and the unscrupulous greed and morals of those that hire them to extract unearned wealth or to impose their will on others—we&#39;re looking at you, corporatists, environmentalists and so–called social justice warriors).</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/2ce46c88-1c0a-4a94-acb9-5ef46f964a18.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-31px;width:323px;height:215px;" src="media/16df789d-918e-4d8d-b72d-55429b0fe34e.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-38.5px;width:153px;height:230px;" src="media/9f7be9e3-c391-4383-b1e4-417588b77317.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:663px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-79px;top:0;width:651px;height:663px;" src="media/9be4e693-b3c1-4f89-a4b9-d8e995a05292.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-38.5px;width:153px;height:230px;" src="media/929cae67-1ff9-4c0c-aa88-a00e63339576.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/7df0acb8-f5a3-4cda-95d3-8f5f0849f116.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/4a904449-6919-48b4-85c6-5c0a9f609e2a.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>The famous Grasse perfume factory is centered in a region known for its lavender and other fragrant flowers.

Now modern chemical processes are used, but other ancient methods remain, such as the &quot;Nose,&quot; who designs each fragrance.

Since it only took exact change and we hadn&#39;t been using cash, the first trick was coming up with payment. Once inside, it is apparent the whole dank, cold and dripping room is sprayed with water and disinfectant between uses. Unfortunately it is not clear what triggers this action, so the unfamiliar user anxiously sits on the ice cold still wet stainless steel seat contemplating if they will make it out of this place dry, and agonizing over whether it is such a good idea to press the flush button! I picture that most users prepare for exit by edging as close to the door as possible, stretching out to trigger the button whilst leaping out of the target zone all in one motion (at least that was my approach). </span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;height:238px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-40px;width:493px;height:318px;" src="media/d4f1490f-47b8-43ce-9fd6-785f74bbeaba.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>This will sound as a discordant contradiction to my earlier bemoaning of America&#39;s self–imposed deprivation of the joys of emergent order and the resultant dividends of delightful architecture and urban environments, but hear me out. A visit to St. Paul de Vence seems oddly similar to a visit to a zoo, or natural history museum. There is a voyeuristic allure to peeking in on the lives of a people who forego the modern expectations of privacy, space and mobility in a self–inflicted frozen state of deprivation and subservience to an imagined ascetic ideal (that is historically non–existent), compensated by an almost Disneyesque make–believe life as a simple medieval village. A land whom time has forgotten. One whose existence is predicated on the productivity and excess wealth produced by those who cannot realistically live in such a commercially produced fictional place. Essentially, they live as actors in a production sustained by patrons here to see the show (all that is missing are period costumes and traveling minstrels). The hidden irony: changing almost anything here is illegal in a similarly oppressive way as America&#39;s system of Landuse controls. Fortunately, the people who live there self–select — they clearly enjoy the other rich rewards of their environment and preserve it for those of us who enjoy a visit but would find the place too stifling to call home.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Cynical observations aside, St. Paul de Vence really is </span><span class="italic"><span>impossibly</span></span><span> quaint. Every corner turns up a new visual wonder. To the observant eye, even such mundain affairs as doors, windows, passageways and storm water control engender delight.</span></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:323px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:0;top:-31px;width:323px;height:215px;" src="media/bf2f7d6d-41be-4926-8d16-db515e0e7585.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:394.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/402efee6-e53c-46fb-94b5-b7b3fedb57bc.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:224.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:153px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-38.5px;top:0;width:230px;height:153px;" src="media/1be143a2-3776-462e-b5d3-e0f043b0c851.jpg"></div><div class="pointer crop abs" style="left:54.5px;top:-10000px;width:153px;height:323px;"><img class="abs click-through" style="opacity:1;left:-31px;top:0;width:215px;height:323px;" src="media/8574bc36-e11f-4ae0-b906-a6ab06256c5e.jpg"></div><div class="text abs pre aa body abs" style="font-size:16.78181818181818px;left:53.5px;top:-10000px;width:493px;"><span>Turning inland to the foothills of the Alps we wind through several ordinary towns inevitably layered in the rich history of conquest by the Romans, Greeks, Tuscans and others;

A time that is outright illegal in America! More and more, as we visit various sites, I am struck at how delightful they are, and how forbidden these architectural treats are to everyday America— forbidden to us at home by the well–meaning but darkly oppressive overlords of the administrative state who have decided to take care of us and prevent all manner of imagined and real harms—at the expense of variety, wonder, and imagination. It is abundantly clear, in contrast with this environment, that it is not worth the price. \n\nThe problem for urban planners everywhere is denialism of the unpredictable (and therefore un–plan–able) wonders of emergent order. The best environments aren't planned, they emerge from the myriad decisions of individuals. Medieval and Renaissance Europe is a testament to this reality so central to human nature. It is too bad that we deny its full flower in our country (I also blame the lobbyists, lawyers and the unscrupulous greed and morals of those that hire them to extract unearned wealth or to impose their will on others—we're looking at you, corporatists, environmentalists and so–called social justice warriors).","rich_text":"","text_style":"body","modifiers":[{"range":[407,414],"style":["bold","italic"]}],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149592,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149592","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416630,"uuid":148496695360058100,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/d4f1490f-47b8-43ce-9fd6-785f74bbeaba.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1320}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":660},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":3},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149593,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149593","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416631,"uuid":148496703203373500,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/16df789d-918e-4d8d-b72d-55429b0fe34e.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1364}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":682},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":4,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149594,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149594","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416632,"uuid":148496711034270850,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/0991f8ed-9910-4847-884a-e3400277e2d7.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149595,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149595","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416634,"uuid":148496728986231300,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/9be4e693-b3c1-4f89-a4b9-d8e995a05292.jpg","size":{"width":2011,"height":2047}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1006,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":6,"height":8},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149596,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149596","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"text","text":{"id":2596012,"plain_text":"This will sound as a discordant contradiction to my earlier bemoaning of America's self–imposed deprivation of the joys of emergent order and the resultant dividends of delightful architecture and urban environments, but hear me out. A visit to St. Paul de Vence seems oddly similar to a visit to a zoo, or natural history museum. There is a voyeuristic allure to peeking in on the lives of a people who forego the modern expectations of privacy, space and mobility in a self–inflicted frozen state of deprivation and subservience to an imagined ascetic ideal (that is historically non–existent), compensated by an almost Disneyesque make–believe life as a simple medieval village. A land whom time has forgotten. One whose existence is predicated on the productivity and excess wealth produced by those who cannot realistically live in such a commercially produced fictional place. Essentially, they live as actors in a production sustained by patrons here to see the show (all that is missing are period costumes and traveling minstrels). The hidden irony: changing almost anything here is illegal in a similarly oppressive way as America's system of Landuse controls. Fortunately, the people who live there self–select — they clearly enjoy the other rich rewards of their environment and preserve it for those of us who enjoy a visit but would find the place too stifling to call home.\n\nCynical observations aside, St. Paul de Vence really is impossibly quaint.

Since it only took exact change and we hadn't been using cash, the first trick was coming up with payment. Once inside, it is apparent the whole dank, cold and dripping room is sprayed with water and disinfectant between uses.
