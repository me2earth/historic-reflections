A visit to St. Paul de Vence seems oddly similar to a visit to a zoo, or natural history museum. There is a voyeuristic allure to peeking in on the lives of a people who forego the modern expectations of privacy, space and mobility in a self–inflicted frozen state of deprivation and subservience to an imagined ascetic ideal (that is historically non–existent), compensated by an almost Disneyesque make–believe life as a simple medieval village. A land whom time has forgotten. One whose existence is predicated on the productivity and excess wealth produced by those who cannot realistically live in such a commercially produced fictional place. Essentially, they live as actors in a production sustained by patrons here to see the show (all that is missing are period costumes and traveling minstrels). The hidden irony: changing almost anything here is illegal in a similarly oppressive way as America&#39;s system of Landuse controls. Fortunately, the people who live there self–select — they clearly enjoy the other rich rewards of their environment and preserve it for those of us who enjoy a visit but would find the place too stifling to call home.</span><br><span></span><br><span>Cynical observations aside, St. Paul de Vence really is </span><span class="italic"><span>impossibly</span></span><span> quaint.

A visit to St. Paul de Vence seems oddly similar to a visit to a zoo, or natural history museum. There is a voyeuristic allure to peeking in on the lives of a people who forego the modern expectations of privacy, space and mobility in a self–inflicted frozen state of deprivation and subservience to an imagined ascetic ideal (that is historically non–existent), compensated by an almost Disneyesque make–believe life as a simple medieval village. A land whom time has forgotten. One whose existence is predicated on the productivity and excess wealth produced by those who cannot realistically live in such a commercially produced fictional place. Essentially, they live as actors in a production sustained by patrons here to see the show (all that is missing are period costumes and traveling minstrels). The hidden irony: changing almost anything here is illegal in a similarly oppressive way as America's system of Landuse controls. Fortunately, the people who live there self–select — they clearly enjoy the other rich rewards of their environment and preserve it for those of us who enjoy a visit but would find the place too stifling to call home.\n\nCynical observations aside, St. Paul de Vence really is impossibly quaint. Every corner turns up a new visual wonder. To the observant eye, even such mundain affairs as doors, windows, passageways and storm water control engender delight.","rich_text":"","text_style":"body","modifiers":[{"range":[1446,1456],"style":["italic"]}],"alignment":"left"}},"layout_type":"block","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149597,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149597","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416635,"uuid":148496736335729730,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/7df0acb8-f5a3-4cda-95d3-8f5f0849f116.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1364}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":1024,"height":682},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149598,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149598","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416636,"uuid":148496743966823070,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/62ce2e10-0233-44b9-a6ac-029f770049a6.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149599,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149599","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416637,"uuid":148496750224895800,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/fd80918b-306a-4b62-935d-483c14b2b782.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149600,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149600","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416638,"uuid":148496758900167070,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/05862ae9-cf17-4de8-83ad-8c4658267548.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":4},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149601,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149601","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416639,"uuid":148496766436592860,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/99d1edda-0042-4bc6-8fe2-6401ac450d71.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":4},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149602,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149602","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416640,"uuid":148496774573947420,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/aea51084-3e9a-4ddf-bee6-f598b2d8ec95.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149603,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149603","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416641,"uuid":148496780604747170,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/0829b96f-ca53-4c56-866d-d5d6e232a19c.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149604,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149604","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416642,"uuid":148496786922967800,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/ada6f4db-fa0e-4a6b-9c9f-75b6a4288371.jpg","size":{"width":1364,"height":2048}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width":682,"height":1024},"low_res_preview":null}},"layout_type":"grid","grid_size":{"width":2,"height":2},"title":null,"mute":false},{"id":12149605,"updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"content":{"id":"fake_ma_from_element_12149605","updated_at":1455980447,"created_at":1455980447,"type":"image","image":{"id":1416643,"uuid":148496793178592420,"is_processing":false,"representations":{"2048":{"url":"media/2ce46c88-1c0a-4a94-acb9-5ef46f964a18.jpg","size":{"width":2048,"height":1364}}},"zoom":1,"focalpoint":{"x":0.5,"y":0.5},"size":{"width"
